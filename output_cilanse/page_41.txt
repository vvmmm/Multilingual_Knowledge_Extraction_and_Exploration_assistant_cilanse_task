### KAMANDAKIVA NITISARA. 25
rthe infliction of punishments and following thé path chalked
out in the Vedas,* frames rules of conduct for his subects.
Thus ends the second Section, the division of lear ning, the

### SECTION IIL
_ A RULER of earth, impartially inflicting putiish-
inents on his subjects like Dandi+ himself, should treat them
### mercifully even as Prajdpatit does.
2. Sweet and truthful speech, kindness, charity, protec-
tion of the oppressed seeking refuge, and association with
the virtuous,—these are the praiseworthy practices of a pious
### person.
3. A miati should extricate a distressed persori out of his
difficulties, being actuated by tenderest compassion and
moved by the heavy weight of the latter’s grief that had
### touched his heart.
4. There is no ore more pious, in respect to the perfor=
mance of meritorious acts, than those who save the distressed
### sunk in the mire of grief.
5. Nursing tenderest compassion in his heart, and with-
out deviating from the path of duty, a king should :wipe away
the tears of the oppressed and the helpless.
