### 12 KAMANDAKIYA NITISARA.
‘' sages,’ even as evening twilight can enhance the beauty of
“the charming moon shedding silvery beams.
53. Even illustrious persons are pierced by (the charms
of) women that enrapture and intoxicate the mind, even as
### rocks are pierced by drops of water.
84. (Excessive indulgence in) hunting, gambling at dice,
and drinking,—these are condemnable when found in a ruler
of the earth. Behold the catastrophe that befell the king
Pandu, the king of the Nishadhas and the descendants of
Vrishni, through indulgence in each of these respectively.*
55. Lust, anger, avarice, fiendish delight in doing injury,
morbid desire for honor, and arrogance, these six passions
### should be victimized.
56—57. Subjecting themselves to these six inimical pas-
sions, the following kings were ruined, namely, king Dandaka
* Pandu.—To the readers of the Mahabharata the allusion
contained in this line is evident. Once during a hunting excursion king
Pandu was very much disappointed for not having lighted on any game
fora long time. At last to his great joy he found within an arrow-shot
a pair of consorting deer and he instantly pierced them with his shaft.
To his horror he found that it was a Risht who had been copulating
with his spouse in the form ofa deer. Provoked by the king’s untimely
interruption, the Risht cursed the monarch saying that he should
never more know sexual pleasure on pain of death. After a. period the
king died for having passionately embraced his junior wife, in accordance
### with the curse of the Rishi.
Naishadha.—The history of Nala is too well-known. He was poss-
essed by Kali who induced him to play at dice with his brother Puskara.
In the game Nala lost all he had, his kingdom and wealth. He was then
driven to forest with his wife, where he forsook her. After a prolonged
separation, during which each of them had to undergo various troubles
and calamities, they were re-united and Nala was set free from the evil
influence of Kali. He regained his kingdom and ruled for a long time.
Vrishnis.—The descendants of Vrishni indulging over-much in
intoxicating drink lost all their senses, and for a trifle quarreling with
each other fell to slaying each other and thus ruined their own line of
kings. This history is also related in the latter part of the Mahabharata.
