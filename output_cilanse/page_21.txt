### KAMANDAKIYA NITISARA, 5
governed this earth for a long period, whilst king Nalusa. *
treading evil ways, was condemned to dwell in the nether
### regions (hell).
15. For this reason, always keeping equity in view, a
king should exert himself for securing prosperity (in th
ishape of territorial aggrandisement &c). Through equitable
dealings, an empire increases in territorial wealth ; and the
delicious fruit of this increase of territory is all-round pros-
### perity.
16. King, minister, kingdom, castle, treasury, army
-and allies, are known to form the seven constituents of
government ; good sense and unebbing energy arc its primary
### ‘stay,
17. Depending upon his unmitigating energy and dis-
cerning through his prudence the right path to be adop-
ted, a king should always vigorously endeavour to establish
a government having those seven constituents.
18. The acquirement of wealth by equitable means, its
preservation and augmentation, and its bestowal on deserving
yecepients—these are said to be the four duties of a sovereign,
never direct or allow his subjects to be engaged in pious deeds, Indrasena
agreed ; and his iniquity speedily brought about his destruction. Several
of his descendants, following the path of their predecessor, met with
ruin. Descended from this doomed line of kings Vaijavana directed
the performance of virtuous acts by his subjects, and himself per-
formed them. ‘Thus his virtue saved him, and he continued to rule over
### his subjects for a long time.
* The allusion is this—Descended from the lunar race of kings,
Nahusa was a very wise and powerful king ; and when Indra lay con-
cealed under: waters to expiate for the sin of having killed Vritra, a
Brdéhmana, he was asked to occupy Indra’s scat. While there, he thought
of winning the love of Indrani and caused the seven celestial sages to con-
vey him in a palanquin to her house. On his way, he asked them to be
quick using the words Sarpa, Sarpa (move on), when one of the sages
cursed him to bea Sarpa (serpent). He fell down from the sky,;and
remained in that wretched state till he was relieved by Yudhisthira.
