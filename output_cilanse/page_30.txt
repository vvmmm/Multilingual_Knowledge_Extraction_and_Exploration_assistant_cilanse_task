### p4 KAMANDAKIYA NITISARA.
59. Association with a preceptor bestows knowledge of
the Shastras ; the knowledge of the Shéstras increases humi-
lity. A king, modest through the effects of culture, never
### sinks under troubles.
60. A king, serving the elderly people, is held in high
respect by the pious; though induced by persons of evil
character, he does not commit vile deeds.
61. A king, everyday receiving lessons in the different
arts from his preceptor, increases in prosperity, like the moon
increasing in her digits during the light half of every month.
62. The prosperity of a monarch, who keeps his passions
under his thorough control and who follows the path chalked
out in the science of Polity, blazes forth every day; his
### fame also reaches the heavens.
63. Thus a monarch, well-versed in Polity, practising
self-control, very soon attains to that shining pitch of pros-
perity which had been attained by other divine monarchs and
-which is as high as the highest peak of AZahiratuagiri *
64. Naturally the ways of exalted sovereignty are differ-
ent from those of the world. Therefore through sheer force,
a preceptor should coach it in self-control. And _ self-con-
trol goes before the successful observance of the maxims of
### Polity.
65. A self-controlled king receives the highest of
homages. Self-control is the ornament of kings. A self-
controlled king appears as beautiful as a gentle elephant
shedding ichor and moving its trunk slowly.
66. A preceptor is worshipped for the acquisition of
learning. Learning, which has been mastered, becomes ins-
trumental in enhancing the prudence of the illustrious. The
sought after by the pious—a person controlling his senses should devote
himself to the services of his preceptor.’
