### KAMANDAKIYA NITISARA, 7
2%, The mind, out of a morbid™ desire for the objects of
sensual enjoyments which are compared to most palatable
dishes of meat, goads the senses after their search; this
(perverse) inclination of the mind should be assiduously sup-
pressed; and when one’s mind is conqueréd (by himself),
### he is styled self-controlled.
28. . Vijyudna (means for realising diverse kinds of know-
ledge), Hridaya (the heart), Chvttwa (the receptacle of con-
sciousness), Afazas (the mind), and Buddht (the intelligence),
—all these are said to convey the same meaning. With the
assistance of any one of these, the soul, incased inside this
body, discriminates between what ought to be done and: what
### ought not to be done.
29. Pious and impious deeds, sensations pleasurable
and otherwise, the presence and absence of desire, so also
human effort, the perception of sense-objects and the re-
membrance of the impressions of an antecedent birth,* these
are said to be the signs that go to prove the existence of the
### soul.
30. The impossibility of the concomitance of perceptions
soul and the mind, which it is difficult to explain to the uninitiated. The
idea seems to be that, the soul is the only living principle that retains
the power of invigorating the subsidiary faculties, which latter, but for the
former’s help, would have been as inert as matter itself. In the Nydya
philosophy mind or Manas is regarded as a Dravya or substance; it is
held to be distinct from the A¢maz or soul. It is defined as the internal
organ of perception and congnition, the instrument by which the objects of
### the senses affect the soul or Atmaz.
"® Samskéva.—lt means the faculty that retains and reproduces im-
pressions. But the word is more oftenused to signify the impressions
received in a previous life, which the soul is said to bring with it when
it is born anew. The absolute truth of this philosophical maxim has gone
out of date; and it is against modern philosophical conceptions. ‘As a
matter of fact none of us can ever remember what had been his condition
in an antecedent life, even if the doctrine of transmigration of souls be
### _ accepted as true.
