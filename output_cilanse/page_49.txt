falsehood, compliance with the advices of those older in age
and in learning, energy, amiable appéarance, appreciation of
worth in other people, and smiling words,—these are known

.20. Under a king unmoved by the passions and possess-

mythology. He is the god of the firmament, the regent of the atmos-

Vedas, he is placed in the first rank among the gods, but in later mytho-
logy, he falls in the second rank. He is inferior to the Trinity Brakmd
Vishnu and Mahesa, but he is the chief of all the other gods. He sends
the lightning, wields thunder-bolt and pours down rain.

taken together gives the meaning we have embodied in our rendering.
