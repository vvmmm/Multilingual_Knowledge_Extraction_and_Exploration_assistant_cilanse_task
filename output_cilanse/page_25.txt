* The Sloka needs illucidation. What the writer means is this;
: when any action is done, the ‘internal sens¢s’ supply the desire and the
motive only ; the ‘external senses’ then perform what more is needed for
the completion of the act. Between the desire and the actual carrying out
| of theaction, there is another step. The writer calls that step to be
‘Yatna or Pravritiz. Modern philosophers also accept an-analysis of
voluntary action somewhat akin to this one. We shall quote professor
Sully:—‘The initial stage is the rise of some desire. This desire is
accompanied by the representation of some movement (motor
representation) which is recognised as subserving the realisa-
tion of the object. The recognition of the casual relation of the
action to the result involves a germ of belief in the attain-
ability of the object of desire, or in the efficacy of the action. Finally
we have the carrying out of the action thus represented.’ What is known
as ‘ motor representation’ seems to be the yatza of the present author.
The first part of the Sloka being understood the latter does not present
any difficulty. When one can suppress this ‘motor representation’ which
again is the result of experience or association, no action becomes possi-
' ble. Inthe absence of action, the soul is not brought into contact with
the sense-objects and is not plunged headlong into worldliness.

### a reasonable meaning.
There is a supplement to this Sloka, which in the text from which
we are translating is omitted. The Sloka undoubtedly is an interpola-
|! tion as it does not occur in the original text. We subjoin its translation.
“As in this earth,’one is never satiated with enjoying ‘any of the
following viz, rice (food); gold (wealth); cattle and women, so one should
